Upon arrival, Noah quickly comes to realize the camp's notorious owner, Falco (Christopher Lloyd) and his dog Lazaraus ironically loathe children. The double whammy takes a turn as Jake (Corbin Bleu), an optimistic camp leader, lifts Noah’s pessimistic attitude. The friendship snowballs for the good as Noah opens up to fellow campers and together they bond in all the fun and memorable ways camp offers. When all seems well, the “bad guys” show up at camp in search of Noah to take back what he stole. Together, Noah and his fellow campers band together to construct a funhouse hideout in the woods, packed with booby traps, zip lines, and bees. In a “change of heart,” cold-hearted Falco warms to the campers, and steps in to help; and together they all learn a valuable lesson of sticking together.",

According to Lombroso, this film is a response and a coda to his previous documentary, White Noise, for which he spent four-years reporting on the American alt-right. Lombroso will be joined for an in-depth conversation by Nina Gottlieb and Producer Devon Blackwell, a producer at The New Yorker, to discuss the film, their experiences, and the connection to Lombroso’s work on White Noise",

When he's suspended from the Chinese pro basketball league, he finds himself desperate for an opportunity to repair his image, and what could change a 'coach-killer' narrative better than returning home to coach his old high school team? The only problem: his old coach, AVERY SCHMIDT, still holds the reins to the team with an iron fist. It's only after a near-fatal heart attack that Coach Schmidt is forced to accept a co-coach he stubbornly doesn't think he needs. What everyone can agree on is that this ragtag team of high school basketball players desperately needs help from someone. They barely get along, let alone know how to play together, and that's not the only hurdle the team has to overcome.",

In her lifetime, Hardison has seen the pendulum swing toward and away from the Black model. At every setback, she spoke up and rallied her colleagues and clients in the industry to advance change. Now in her 70s, the Brooklyn native is writing her memoir, taking stock of her own legacy at a moment when the fashion industry was shaken by discrimination. In INVISIBLE BEAUTY, Tcheng and Hardison trace her impact on fashion from runway shows in the 1970s to roundtables about the lack of racial diversity in the early 2000s.",

The two brothers are now confronted with new emotional dilemmas…',

When his social posts start blowing up, so does his life and the lives of everyone following him. As a stock tip becomes a movement, everyone gets rich – until the billionaires fight back, and both sides find their worlds turned upside down. \r\n \r\nDumb Money also stars Pete Davidson, Vincent D’Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley and Seth Rogen.
